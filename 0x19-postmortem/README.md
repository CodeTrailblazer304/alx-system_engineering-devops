Impact: The API Gateway, a core component of our microservices architecture, experienced a complete outage. This resulted in a major downtime for our web application, impacting approximately 80% of our user base. Users reported experiencing slow load times, error messages, and intermittent service availability.

Root Cause: A combination of factors contributed to the outage. A misconfiguration of the API Gateway load balancer caused traffic to be distributed unevenly across the backend servers. This overload on certain servers led to resource exhaustion and eventual failure. Additionally, a recent code change introduced a bug that exacerbated the issue by increasing the load on the API Gateway.

Timeline
11:00 AM UTC: The first reports of slow load times and error messages are starting to come in from users.
11:15 AM UTC: The monitoring system triggers alerts for high error rates and CPU usage on the API Gateway.
11:20 AM UTC: The engineer on duty begins investigating the issue, focusing on the API Gateway and its backend servers.
11:30 AM UTC: Initial analysis indicates a potential network issue, but further investigation reveals no network-related issues.
11:45 AM UTC: The incident is escalated to the engineering team lead, who assembles a team to address the issue.
12:00 PM UTC: The team identifies a misconfiguration in the load balancer as the root cause.
12:15 PM UTC: The load balancer configuration is corrected, redistributing traffic more evenly across the backend servers.
12:30 PM UTC: Services are restored, and the API Gateway is operating normally.

Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the API Gateway load balancer that resulted in uneven traffic distribution. This overload on some of the backend servers led to resource exhaustion and failure. Additionally, a recent code change introduced a bug that increased the load on the API Gateway.

To resolve the issue, we as a team corrected the load balancer configuration to ensure that traffic was distributed fairly. We also identified and fixed the bug in the code.

Corrective and Preventive Measures
Review and Improve Monitoring: Enhance the monitoring system to provide more detailed insights into API Gateway performance and identify potential issues early.
Enhance Change Management Processes: Implement more stringent change management procedures to reduce the risk of introducing bugs through code changes.
Conduct Regular Load Testing: Conduct regular load testing to identify potential bottlenecks and ensure that the API Gateway can handle the expected traffic.
Automate Incident Response: Automate the incident response workflow to speed up the process of detecting, diagnosing, and resolving issues.
Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern: Use Circuit Breaker Pattern to protect the API Gateway from cascading failures and isolate faulty services.
Increase Server Capacity: Consider increasing the capacity of your backend servers to handle future growth and prevent resource exhaustion.
